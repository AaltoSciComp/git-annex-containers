# Container definitions for git-annex

Containerized versions of
[git-annex](https://git-annex.branchable.com/), for use when
installing git-annex may be a bit more work than you'd like.  This is
expected to be especially useful on computer clusters, so we provide
extra documentation for that use case.

This works by installing the git-annex standalone distribution inside
of an Alpine Linux container.



## Apptainer / Singularity

[Apptainer](https://apptainer.org/) (formerly
[Singularity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singularity_(software)) is
a container system especially designed for command line apps and/or
HPC clusters.  It emphasizes a good interface for running from the
command line.

Download the latest raw image:
```console
$ wget https://github.com/AaltoSciComp/git-annex-containers/releases/download/latest/git-annex.sif
```

Building from the docker image:
```console
$ apptainer build git-annex.sif docker://ghcr.io/aaltoscicomp/git-annex:latest
```

The Dockerfile is the primary build (and that is how the released
`git-annex.sif` is made).  An old singularity definition
file is included in case it is important for you:
```console
$ apptainer build git-annex.sif git-annex.def
```

Running:
```console
$ ./git-annex.sif [git-annex commands]
```

### Apptainer usage tips

You can rename the `.sif` file to `git-annex` and put it in a
directory on `PATH`, and then it will function exactly like the
`annex` subcommand for your normal git installation: you can run `git
annex`.

For use as a remote over SSH, you need to set up **git-annex-shell**.
You can use `git-annex.sif shell` can be used, for
example: `git config remote.NAME.annex-shell "/path/to/git-annex.sif
shell"` Special cases that may occur:
* If your repo is not in the default bind-mounted filesystems ($TMP,
  $HOME), you need to bind mount it.  This can be used: `git config
  remote.NAME.annex-shell "apptainer run -B /scratch /path/to/git-annex.sif
  shell"`

On your own computer,this git-annex container can access your SSH
authentication (keys, ControlMaster sockets).  But there are some
special cases:
* To access your SSH agent, you need to bind the socket inside.  You
  can `export SINGULARITY_BIND=$SSH_AUTH_SOCK` or run `apptainer run
  -B $SSH_AUTH_SOCK git_annex.sif`

* git-annex sets up its own ControlMaster for mulitplexing.  If you
  already have one running, set `git config annex.sshcaching false` it
  can automatically re-user existing ssh ControlMaster from `/tmp`,
  which is bind-mounted by default.



## Docker

There's a Dockerfile here, but there may not be much use for it since
the point of this repo is to run against local data, and docker isn't
the ideal way to do that.  Still, might be useful.

The Dockerfile is made mainly so that you can build Apptainer from
docker by pulling the image (and this is the main way that Apptainer
is build now).

```console
$ docker pull ghcr.io/aaltoscicomp/git-annex:latest
```



## Status

As of 2023, just created and seems to work.  Improvements welcome
(including usage tips)
